                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Wee Jammin Music Lessons is a music program that offers a unique curriculum that allows
                    children to explore instruments, create music and jam with their peers.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This program is designed primarily for children with autism and other related disorders; however, it is open to any child who is seeking a nontraditional approach to music.

                <h3>Benefits of Music</h3>
                <p>Music is a universal language that has been proven to help with listening skills, patience, concentration, memory, cognition, fine/gross motor skills and sensory integration/regulation are just to name a few.</p>

                <h3>Reviews</h3>
                    <p>Our autistic son loves music, but we struggled to find classes that were a good fit for him.  They were either too basic and focused on music appreciation or too intense of a schedule.  Wee Jammin’ music lessons and Donnia are a perfect fit.  Donnia plays a variety of instruments and is a wonderful teacher with her years of working with kiddos.  She introduced our son to a variety of instruments, and follows his lead and interest to learn songs that he loves.  She is teaching him how to read music, tempo, rhythm, etc.  This is such a great concept and business, to allow kids that need more supports access to extracurricular activities of their peers.  I highly recommend Wee Jammin’ music lessons to anyone with a music loving kiddo that wants to explore that interest and foster a life long skill of playing an instrument.

                <p>I have worked in early childhood education for the past 15 years in a plethora of different forms including summer camps, special education, swim lessons, teaching art and music and most recently, behavior therapy for children with autism.  I see there is a need for more extra curricular activities for children with special needs.  Those that learn differently, often need to be taught differently.  I believe all children deserve a chance at exploring their creative talents, discovering an effective outlet for their emotions/feelings and broadening their skills of communication and socialization through music.</p>
