                <p>I have worked in early childhood education for the past 15 years in a plethora of different forms including summer camps, special education, swim lessons, teaching art and music and most recently, behavior therapy for children with autism.  I see there is a need for more extra curricular activities for children with special needs.  Those that learn differently, often need to be taught differently.  I believe all children deserve a chance at exploring their creative talents, discovering an effective outlet for their emotions/feelings and broadening their skills of communication and socialization through music.</p>
