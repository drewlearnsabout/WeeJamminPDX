                <h3>Reviews</h3>
                    <p>Our autistic son loves music, but we struggled to find classes that were a good fit for him.  They were either too basic and focused on music appreciation or too intense of a schedule.  Wee Jammin’ music lessons and Donnia are a perfect fit.  Donnia plays a variety of instruments and is a wonderful teacher with her years of working with kiddos.  She introduced our son to a variety of instruments, and follows his lead and interest to learn songs that he loves.  She is teaching him how to read music, tempo, rhythm, etc.  This is such a great concept and business, to allow kids that need more supports access to extracurricular activities of their peers.  I highly recommend Wee Jammin’ music lessons to anyone with a music loving kiddo that wants to explore that interest and foster a life long skill of playing an instrument.
